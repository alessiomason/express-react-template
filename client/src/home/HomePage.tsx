            <p>This is intended to be a template for building a web application in its client
                and server parts. The web application is developed using the Express framework for the server and React
                for the client.</p>
            <p>Both the client and the server offer few basic functionalities and are merely intended to be a starting
                point to develop a fully-fledged application.</p>
